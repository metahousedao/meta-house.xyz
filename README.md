## What's MetaHouse?

MetaHouse is a free open-source house building solution provider, a collaboration of talented architects, designers, and collaborators to create modern living spaces with a contemporary feel. Through aesthetic and rich designs, houses are made into prefabricated, composable modules that allow people anywhere in the world to create a usable, reliable, and aesthetically pleasing home through simple combinations.

## Our Vision

MetaHouse's vision is to create a world where everyone can live in design housing. Everyone will be able to live in a decent home with free access to practical architectural designs and prefabricated modular combinations at cost. We want everyone in the world to be able to get rid of the heavy mortgage and live a meaningful and easy life.

## Our Value

### Open Source

MetaHouse design and hardware resources will be open and freely published on the web for everyone to use.

### Sustainability

On-demand, local production, reducing waste from garment production as well as shipping.

### Decentralization

MetaHouse believe that decentralization makes the world a better place and more beneficial for every MetaHouse participant.

### Composability

All designs and hardware are combinable for easy interfacing with other hardware facilities.
